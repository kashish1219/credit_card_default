1. Bill-to-Limit Ratio

        Idea: Measure how much of a customer’s credit limit is being used each month.

        utilization = BILL_AMT / LIMIT_BAL per month.

        High utilization (close to 100%) can indicate higher risk of default.

        Approach:

        Compute average utilization over 6 months.

        Optionally, compute trend like bill_trend to see if utilization is increasing.

        EDA Insight:

        Bin the average utilization and calculate default rate per bin.

        You’ll likely see higher default rates with higher utilization.

2. Recent Payment Behavior

        Idea: Recent repayment behavior can be a stronger signal than long-term trends.

        Focus on PAY_0 (most recent month) and PAY_2 (month before).

        Approach:

        Compute a recent payment score (e.g., average of last 1–2 months).

        Check correlation with DEFAULT or bin by recent payment status.

        EDA Insight:

        Customers who paid late recently are often at higher risk, even if their long-term trend is okay.

3. Combined Categorical Analysis

        Idea: Some categories interact — for example, sex and education together might reveal patterns not visible individually.

        Approach:

        Cross-tabulate default rate by combinations:

        pd.crosstab([df['SEX'], df['EDUCATION']], df['DEFAULT'], normalize='index')


        Or add MARRIAGE to see 3-way interactions.

        EDA Insight:

        Certain groups may have higher or lower default risk, which helps in feature creation.
